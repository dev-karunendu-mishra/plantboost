                    <li><strong>How to Ship and what is the Shipping Cost?</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Shipping of the order is based on the shipping options available in the respective area or country.
                    Shipping cost may vary and is dependent on the exact location and shipping options. Shipping depends
                    on the product ordered, the total weight of the product, and the location to which the shipping is
                    being done.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Where do you Ship?</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>We offer International Shipping to our customers. However, due to the security reasons, we canâ€™t
                    deliver shipments to the military areas.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>How Long will My Order take to be Delivered?</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>A minimum of 3-5 days are required for the processing of the order. Due to factors that commonly
                    affect international shipments, such as delays due to weather conditions, holidays, and custom
                    inspections, shipping times cannot be guranteed.</p>

                    <li><strong>How can I Track my Order?</strong></li>

                <p>You will be sent the tracking id of the orders to the email provided by you, while placing the
                    orders. This tracking id will guide you on the tracking of the package. Please note that the
                    tracking information will be made available only after 2-5 days of receiving the confirmation mail.
                </p>

                    <li>Shipment may be delayed&nbsp;due to many reasons like bad weather conditions, customs or
                        backlogs. Please note that the tracking information is available&nbsp;only after the order has
                        been shipped from our end.</li>
